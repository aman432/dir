Technical Enhancements and Feature Delivery
Validations on Decimal Places for P2P Transactions:

Implemented validations for decimal places on all amounts in P2P transaction APIs.
Managed the task end-to-end, including development, testing, and cross-team collaboration with the dev-ex team for documentation updates.
Banking Transfer Writes Removal:

Removed banking transfer writes in the database.
Introduced a banking write feature flag to enable/disable banking writes at runtime, enhancing task flexibility and control.
Performance Optimization
DB Query Optimization for Last Authorization API:
Worked on optimizing the "get last authorization" API query.
Identified limitations due to excessive indexes on the authorizations table, impacting write performance.
Implemented a caching solution with a TTL of 10 minutes based on read patterns, significantly improving performance (reduced p99 from 2-3 seconds to 150ms).
Dedicated effort to performance enhancement led to better API results.
API and Endpoint Development
Creation of PATCH Endpoints for Payment-Configs Routes:
Evaluated configurations and determined the need for a design document.
Explored multiple strategies (e.g., JSON patch and merge) and finalized on JSON merge based on use cases.
Designed a mature product by addressing edge cases early and writing a comprehensive design document.
Approach to designing new features was accepted and implemented within the team.
Process Improvement and Problem Solving
Authorization Status Check in Installments API:
Thoroughly reviewed the flow to understand the need for skipping authorization status checks.
Executed a POC by creating a blocked account status in an external environment.
Added necessary changes to ledger API calls based on POC results.
Demonstrated the value of running POCs for gaining confidence in task execution.
